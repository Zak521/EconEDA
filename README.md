# EconEDA
This project is a comprehensive economic data visualization and analysis tool built in Python using publicly available macroeconomic indicators from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) API. It focuses on analyzing U.S. economic conditions, particularly the S&P 500 Index, unemployment rates, and labor force participation rates across U.S. states, with a spotlight on the impact during the COVID-19 pandemic.
# Key Findings
- The S&P 500 rebounded sharply post-COVID despite widespread unemployment.

- In May 2020, states like Nevada, Hawaii, and Michigan had the highest unemployment rates, reflecting their tourism and manufacturing dependencies.

- Labor participation rates did not rebound as quickly as unemployment fell in many states, showing potential structural changes in the labor market.

- California had a steep unemployment spike in 2020 but also showed a gradual participation rate decline, hinting at lasting labor shifts.
